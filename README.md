# Plex User Manager

Plex User Manager is a tool to help manage your users from your plex servers. As we now can't clearly identify our users, this will help you make the difference.
Creation, edition, or deletion of users and access is no longer a problem.
Also adding access expiration to stop user access when date passed.
I'd be glad to have some help with python and docker(GitHub).

left to do:
- in conf tab buttons are done functions not yet working
  * add mail or tautulli conf to send message before account expiration
  * warn users near expiation (with delay / mail or tautulli)
  * warn user of expiration (mail or tautulli)
- build docker container to display pum_web.py
- add help text
- add CHANGES to info tab

bugs:
- minor gui diplay glitch

Usage:
 - run python3 pum.py
